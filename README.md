<h1 align="center">Travel Information And Service Management</h1>
<p>A travel information and service management system is used to book a tour from anywhere in the world through a single, dynamic website that will help the user know all about the places and tour details on a single website. The main purpose of our project, "Travel Information and Service Management System," is to provide a convenient way for a customer to book hotels, flights, trains, and buses for tour purposes. We simplified the process of searching for and booking trains, flights, and buses in this project.</p>
